# CLIP Fine-Tuning with PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of OpenAI's CLIP model for tasks such as image classification, visual search, and visual question answering (VQA). The repository is currently a work in progress.

## Overview

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is a powerful model developed by OpenAI that can understand images and text in a joint embedding space. This project aims to provide scripts and examples for fine-tuning CLIP on custom datasets for various tasks.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Fine-tune CLIP for classifying images into custom categories.
- **Visual Search**: Implement visual search functionality by leveraging CLIP's image and text embeddings.
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: Extend CLIP to answer questions about images.


## Usage

### Image Classification

Instructions and scripts for fine-tuning CLIP on an image classification task will be provided here.

### Visual Search

Instructions and scripts for implementing visual search using CLIP will be provided here.

### Visual Question Answering (VQA)

Instructions and scripts for setting up VQA with CLIP will be provided here.
